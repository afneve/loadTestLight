During wet weather, the loop may not be passable, as the Yellow River tributaries flow west to east through the entire section, with little structure at critical wet crossings. A primitive campsite (TA24) is located on the loop 0.1 miles south of its western intersection with the Ice Age Trail. A second secluded, primitive campsite (TA17) is located at the southern end of the loop, 2.7 miles south of the Ice Age Trails western intersection and 1.9 miles south of the Ice Age Trails eastern intersection. Situated with pleasant views of the pond and beaver dam, the exceptional site has a log bench, fire pit and small cast iron table made from an old fire grate. A pit toilet is hidden a few yards to the southeast.",

The uppermost part of the Glen, with its jumble of huge fallen rocks, is nearly 100 feet deep. Hikers will pass moss-covered walls moist from seepage before the trail ends at a small waterfall. The Glens unique microclimate grows northern flora, including white pine, yellow birch, mountain maple and rare cliff plants. An unusual aquatic ecosystem flourishes in the fast, cold, hardwater stream that flows through the gorge and the Glen harbors a diverse insect fauna with a few rare and threatened species.

The Aldo Leopold Foundation operates the Aldo Leopold Legacy Center, which is an educational and interpretive facility near the Leopold Shack. Here Aldo Leopold converted a chicken coop on his farm and wrote part of his conservation classic masterpiece on land ethics, A Sand County Almanac. This is also the very same land where Aldo Leopold died in 1948 fighting a brush fire. The Legacy Center is an excellent place to learn more about this famous American naturalist and see how the Leopold Foundation is carrying out his message of land ethics today. The Aldo Leopold Legacy Center is open to the public with limited hours. The Aldo Leopold Shack and Farm are not open to the public, except with special permission on a guided tour.

Listed in the National Register of Historic Places, the Colsac III ferry (commonly referred to as the Merrimac Ferry) is the lone survivor of about 500 ferries that used to operate in the 19th century across Wisconsin. The name Colsac is the phonetic rendering of the two counties the ferry connects, Columbia and Sauk. The ferry crosses the Wisconsin River at a wider part of the river known as Lake Wisconsin, which is a reservoir produced by a dam downstream. At that spot, it is both the Wisconsin River and Lake Wisconsin. The ferry takes seven minutes to cross approximately 0.45 miles. State-operated, the service is free to all, including cars, bikes and pedestrians, and runs 24 hours, 7 days a week April 15 through November 30. The ferry is closed December 1 through April 14. There is a separate lane for pedestrians and bicycles, boarding from the sidewalk on the east (upriver) side of the ferry. Contact the IATA (800-227-0046, iceagetrail.org) for an alternative pedestrian route when the ferry is closed.",

The area represents a world-renowned example of the interface of glaciated and unglaciated terrain. The relationship between moraine and glaciated landscapes on one side of the moraine and unglaciated bedrock landscapes on the other side is strikingly exhibited. Rugged ridges of the moraine formed during the Wisconsin Glaciation meet the eroded Driftless Area to the south and west. Oak savanna, oak forest, wetlands and prairies cover the area.

Some features may be harder to see during the summer months because of ground cover. Wood from the forest has been radiocarbon-dated at 11,850 years before present. Removal of any material is strictly prohibited.",

The Cardy Site, marked by a kiosk and plaque, preserves the remains of a campsite used by Native Americans at the end of the Ice Age. An extensive dig in 2003 unearthed spear points, tools, a fire pit and other artifacts. Archeologists believe that Native Americans lived and worked in this area 11,000 years ago near the shore of Glacial Lake Algonquin and within walking distance of the receding continental ice sheet. This camp is unusual for its far north location. Glacial Lake Algonquin occupied the Lake Michigan and Lake Huron basins at the end of the Ice Age and would have been about 25 feet higher than Green Bay is today.",

A steel sign marks the trail junction (TA16).  The Chippewa Lobe Interpretive Loop, also called the Blue Diamond Trail due to its blazes, is a rugged route that circles a remote roadless area called the Ice Age Primitive Area. Six posts mark the miles oriented counter-clockwise, starting from the Ice Age Trails western access to it at the kiosk. During wet weather, the loop may not be passable, as the Yellow River tributaries flow west to east through the entire section, with little structure at critical wet crossings. A primitive campsite (TA24) is located on the loop 0.1 miles south of its western intersection with the Ice Age Trail. A second secluded, primitive campsite (TA17) is located at the southern end of the loop, 2.7 miles south of the Ice Age Trails western intersection and 1.9 miles south of the Ice Age Trails eastern intersection.

The Glens unique microclimate grows northern flora, including white pine, yellow birch, mountain maple and rare cliff plants. An unusual aquatic ecosystem flourishes in the fast, cold, hardwater stream that flows through the gorge and the Glen harbors a diverse insect fauna with a few rare and threatened species.

The name Colsac is the phonetic rendering of the two counties the ferry connects, Columbia and Sauk. The ferry crosses the Wisconsin River at a wider part of the river known as Lake Wisconsin, which is a reservoir produced by a dam downstream. At that spot, it is both the Wisconsin River and Lake Wisconsin. The ferry takes seven minutes to cross approximately 0.45 miles. State-operated, the service is free to all, including cars, bikes and pedestrians, and runs 24 hours, 7 days a week April 15 through November 30. The ferry is closed December 1 through April 14. There is a separate lane for pedestrians and bicycles, boarding from the sidewalk on the east (upriver) side of the ferry.

From the basement to the cupola, each floor offers visitors a unique glimpse of daily life in 19th century Rock County. Over seventy percent of the furniture is original, making it one of the most complete historic houses in the Midwest. In October of 1859, Abraham Lincoln stayed at the house after a series of speeches in Beloit, forever cementing the reputation of the Lincoln-Tallman House as where Lincoln slept.",

It is world-famous among geologists because it provides a unique, precise record of glacial advances and retreats during the Wisconsin Glaciation. The layers of glacial till and buried forest can be seen on the side of the steep bluff along the lakeshore due to wave erosion. Some features may be harder to see during the summer months because of ground cover. Wood from the forest has been radiocarbon-dated at 11,850 years before present.

Spruce St.  The Cardy Paleo-Indian Camp archaeological site, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is considered one of the most important archaeological finds in Wisconsin. The Cardy Site, marked by a kiosk and plaque, preserves the remains of a campsite used by Native Americans at the end of the Ice Age. An extensive dig in 2003 unearthed spear points, tools, a fire pit and other artifacts. Archeologists believe that Native Americans lived and worked in this area 11,000 years ago near the shore of Glacial Lake Algonquin and within walking distance of the receding continental ice sheet. This camp is unusual for its far north location. Glacial Lake Algonquin occupied the Lake Michigan and Lake Huron basins at the end of the Ice Age and would have been about 25 feet higher than Green Bay is today.",

Access by foot only: (i) From the west, hike the Ice Age Trail 0.5 mi east from Lake 19 Rd. (FR-108) to a kiosk at the start of the Loop (TA23). (ii) From the north, hike the White Birch Trail (Forest Trail 567) south 1.1 mi, cross the Ice Age Trail (TA18) and continue south another 0.5 mi to its intersection with the Chippewa Lobe Interpretive Loop. This is less scenic than the Ice Age Trail access. (iii) From the east, hike the Ice Age Trail 1.6 mi west of where the Ice Age Trail leaves FR-102 after crossing the North Fork of the Yellow River. A steel sign marks the trail junction (TA16).  The Chippewa Lobe Interpretive Loop, also called the Blue Diamond Trail due to its blazes, is a rugged route that circles a remote roadless area called the Ice Age Primitive Area. Six posts mark the miles oriented counter-clockwise, starting from the Ice Age Trails western access to it at the kiosk. During wet weather, the loop may not be passable, as the Yellow River tributaries flow west to east through the entire section, with little structure at critical wet crossings. A primitive campsite (TA24) is located on the loop 0.1 miles south of its western intersection with the Ice Age Trail. A second secluded, primitive campsite (TA17) is located at the southern end of the loop, 2.7 miles south of the Ice Age Trails western intersection and 1.9 miles south of the Ice Age Trails eastern intersection. Situated with pleasant views of the pond and beaver dam, the exceptional site has a log bench, fire pit and small cast iron table made from an old fire grate. A pit toilet is hidden a few yards to the southeast.",

The Glens unique microclimate grows northern flora, including white pine, yellow birch, mountain maple and rare cliff plants. An unusual aquatic ecosystem flourishes in the fast, cold, hardwater stream that flows through the gorge and the Glen harbors a diverse insect fauna with a few rare and threatened species.

Here Aldo Leopold converted a chicken coop on his farm and wrote part of his conservation classic masterpiece on land ethics, A Sand County Almanac. This is also the very same land where Aldo Leopold died in 1948 fighting a brush fire. The Legacy Center is an excellent place to learn more about this famous American naturalist and see how the Leopold Foundation is carrying out his message of land ethics today. The Aldo Leopold Legacy Center is open to the public with limited hours. The Aldo Leopold Shack and Farm are not open to the public, except with special permission on a guided tour.

The name Colsac is the phonetic rendering of the two counties the ferry connects, Columbia and Sauk. The ferry crosses the Wisconsin River at a wider part of the river known as Lake Wisconsin, which is a reservoir produced by a dam downstream. At that spot, it is both the Wisconsin River and Lake Wisconsin. The ferry takes seven minutes to cross approximately 0.45 miles. State-operated, the service is free to all, including cars, bikes and pedestrians, and runs 24 hours, 7 days a week April 15 through November 30. The ferry is closed December 1 through April 14. There is a separate lane for pedestrians and bicycles, boarding from the sidewalk on the east (upriver) side of the ferry. Contact the IATA (800-227-0046, iceagetrail.org) for an alternative pedestrian route when the ferry is closed.",

Two Creeks Buried Forest is a unit of the Ice Age National Scientific Reserve. It is world-famous among geologists because it provides a unique, precise record of glacial advances and retreats during the Wisconsin Glaciation. The layers of glacial till and buried forest can be seen on the side of the steep bluff along the lakeshore due to wave erosion. Some features may be harder to see during the summer months because of ground cover. Wood from the forest has been radiocarbon-dated at 11,850 years before present. Removal of any material is strictly prohibited.",

The Cardy Site, marked by a kiosk and plaque, preserves the remains of a campsite used by Native Americans at the end of the Ice Age. An extensive dig in 2003 unearthed spear points, tools, a fire pit and other artifacts. Archeologists believe that Native Americans lived and worked in this area 11,000 years ago near the shore of Glacial Lake Algonquin and within walking distance of the receding continental ice sheet. This camp is unusual for its far north location. Glacial Lake Algonquin occupied the Lake Michigan and Lake Huron basins at the end of the Ice Age and would have been about 25 feet higher than Green Bay is today.",

The Chippewa Lobe Interpretive Loop, also called the Blue Diamond Trail due to its blazes, is a rugged route that circles a remote roadless area called the Ice Age Primitive Area. Six posts mark the miles oriented counter-clockwise, starting from the Ice Age Trails western access to it at the kiosk. During wet weather, the loop may not be passable, as the Yellow River tributaries flow west to east through the entire section, with little structure at critical wet crossings.

A second secluded, primitive campsite (TA17) is located at the southern end of the loop, 2.7 miles south of the Ice Age Trails western intersection and 1.9 miles south of the Ice Age Trails eastern intersection.

The Glens unique microclimate grows northern flora, including white pine, yellow birch, mountain maple and rare cliff plants. An unusual aquatic ecosystem flourishes in the fast, cold, hardwater stream that flows through the gorge and the Glen harbors a diverse insect fauna with a few rare and threatened species.

The name Colsac is the phonetic rendering of the two counties the ferry connects, Columbia and Sauk. The ferry crosses the Wisconsin River at a wider part of the river known as Lake Wisconsin, which is a reservoir produced by a dam downstream. At that spot, it is both the Wisconsin River and Lake Wisconsin. The ferry takes seven minutes to cross approximately 0.45 miles. State-operated, the service is free to all, including cars, bikes and pedestrians, and runs 24 hours, 7 days a week April 15 through November 30. The ferry is closed December 1 through April 14. There is a separate lane for pedestrians and bicycles, boarding from the sidewalk on the east (upriver) side of the ferry.

Over seventy percent of the furniture is original, making it one of the most complete historic houses in the Midwest.

It is world-famous among geologists because it provides a unique, precise record of glacial advances and retreats during the Wisconsin Glaciation. The layers of glacial till and buried forest can be seen on the side of the steep bluff along the lakeshore due to wave erosion. Some features may be harder to see during the summer months because of ground cover. Wood from the forest has been radiocarbon-dated at 11,850 years before present.

Spruce St.  The Cardy Paleo-Indian Camp archaeological site, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is considered one of the most important archaeological finds in Wisconsin. The Cardy Site, marked by a kiosk and plaque, preserves the remains of a campsite used by Native Americans at the end of the Ice Age. An extensive dig in 2003 unearthed spear points, tools, a fire pit and other artifacts. Archeologists believe that Native Americans lived and worked in this area 11,000 years ago near the shore of Glacial Lake Algonquin and within walking distance of the receding continental ice sheet. This camp is unusual for its far north location. Glacial Lake Algonquin occupied the Lake Michigan and Lake Huron basins at the end of the Ice Age and would have been about 25 feet higher than Green Bay is today.",

(ii) From the north, hike the White Birch Trail (Forest Trail 567) south 1.1 mi, cross the Ice Age Trail (TA18) and continue south another 0.5 mi to its intersection with the Chippewa Lobe Interpretive Loop. This is less scenic than the Ice Age Trail access. (iii) From the east, hike the Ice Age Trail 1.6 mi west of where the Ice Age Trail leaves FR-102 after crossing the North Fork of the Yellow River. A steel sign marks the trail junction (TA16).  The Chippewa Lobe Interpretive Loop, also called the Blue Diamond Trail due to its blazes, is a rugged route that circles a remote roadless area called the Ice Age Primitive Area. Six posts mark the miles oriented counter-clockwise, starting from the Ice Age Trails western access to it at the kiosk. During wet weather, the loop may not be passable, as the Yellow River tributaries flow west to east through the entire section, with little structure at critical wet crossings. A primitive campsite (TA24) is located on the loop 0.1 miles south of its western intersection with the Ice Age Trail. A second secluded, primitive campsite (TA17) is located at the southern end of the loop, 2.7 miles south of the Ice Age Trails western intersection and 1.9 miles south of the Ice Age Trails eastern intersection. Situated with pleasant views of the pond and beaver dam, the exceptional site has a log bench, fire pit and small cast iron table made from an old fire grate. A pit toilet is hidden a few yards to the southeast.",

The uppermost part of the Glen, with its jumble of huge fallen rocks, is nearly 100 feet deep. Hikers will pass moss-covered walls moist from seepage before the trail ends at a small waterfall. The Glens unique microclimate grows northern flora, including white pine, yellow birch, mountain maple and rare cliff plants. An unusual aquatic ecosystem flourishes in the fast, cold, hardwater stream that flows through the gorge and the Glen harbors a diverse insect fauna with a few rare and threatened species. Pets are not allowed in Parfreys Glen SNA except along the Ice Age Trail.",

This is also the very same land where Aldo Leopold died in 1948 fighting a brush fire. The Legacy Center is an excellent place to learn more about this famous American naturalist and see how the Leopold Foundation is carrying out his message of land ethics today.

The name Colsac is the phonetic rendering of the two counties the ferry connects, Columbia and Sauk. The ferry crosses the Wisconsin River at a wider part of the river known as Lake Wisconsin, which is a reservoir produced by a dam downstream. At that spot, it is both the Wisconsin River and Lake Wisconsin. The ferry takes seven minutes to cross approximately 0.45 miles. State-operated, the service is free to all, including cars, bikes and pedestrians, and runs 24 hours, 7 days a week April 15 through November 30. The ferry is closed December 1 through April 14. There is a separate lane for pedestrians and bicycles, boarding from the sidewalk on the east (upriver) side of the ferry. Contact the IATA (800-227-0046, iceagetrail.org) for an alternative pedestrian route when the ferry is closed.",

Two Creeks Buried Forest is a unit of the Ice Age National Scientific Reserve. It is world-famous among geologists because it provides a unique, precise record of glacial advances and retreats during the Wisconsin Glaciation. The layers of glacial till and buried forest can be seen on the side of the steep bluff along the lakeshore due to wave erosion. Some features may be harder to see during the summer months because of ground cover. Wood from the forest has been radiocarbon-dated at 11,850 years before present. Removal of any material is strictly prohibited.",

The Cardy Site, marked by a kiosk and plaque, preserves the remains of a campsite used by Native Americans at the end of the Ice Age. An extensive dig in 2003 unearthed spear points, tools, a fire pit and other artifacts. Archeologists believe that Native Americans lived and worked in this area 11,000 years ago near the shore of Glacial Lake Algonquin and within walking distance of the receding continental ice sheet. This camp is unusual for its far north location. Glacial Lake Algonquin occupied the Lake Michigan and Lake Huron basins at the end of the Ice Age and would have been about 25 feet higher than Green Bay is today.",

The Chippewa Lobe Interpretive Loop, also called the Blue Diamond Trail due to its blazes, is a rugged route that circles a remote roadless area called the Ice Age Primitive Area. Six posts mark the miles oriented counter-clockwise, starting from the Ice Age Trails western access to it at the kiosk. During wet weather, the loop may not be passable, as the Yellow River tributaries flow west to east through the entire section, with little structure at critical wet crossings.

The uppermost part of the Glen, with its jumble of huge fallen rocks, is nearly 100 feet deep. Hikers will pass moss-covered walls moist from seepage before the trail ends at a small waterfall. The Glens unique microclimate grows northern flora, including white pine, yellow birch, mountain maple and rare cliff plants. An unusual aquatic ecosystem flourishes in the fast, cold, hardwater stream that flows through the gorge and the Glen harbors a diverse insect fauna with a few rare and threatened species.

The name Colsac is the phonetic rendering of the two counties the ferry connects, Columbia and Sauk. The ferry crosses the Wisconsin River at a wider part of the river known as Lake Wisconsin, which is a reservoir produced by a dam downstream. At that spot, it is both the Wisconsin River and Lake Wisconsin. The ferry takes seven minutes to cross approximately 0.45 miles. State-operated, the service is free to all, including cars, bikes and pedestrians, and runs 24 hours, 7 days a week April 15 through November 30. The ferry is closed December 1 through April 14. There is a separate lane for pedestrians and bicycles, boarding from the sidewalk on the east (upriver) side of the ferry.

The layers of glacial till and buried forest can be seen on the side of the steep bluff along the lakeshore due to wave erosion. Some features may be harder to see during the summer months because of ground cover. Wood from the forest has been radiocarbon-dated at 11,850 years before present.

Spruce St.  The Cardy Paleo-Indian Camp archaeological site, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is considered one of the most important archaeological finds in Wisconsin. The Cardy Site, marked by a kiosk and plaque, preserves the remains of a campsite used by Native Americans at the end of the Ice Age. An extensive dig in 2003 unearthed spear points, tools, a fire pit and other artifacts. Archeologists believe that Native Americans lived and worked in this area 11,000 years ago near the shore of Glacial Lake Algonquin and within walking distance of the receding continental ice sheet. This camp is unusual for its far north location. Glacial Lake Algonquin occupied the Lake Michigan and Lake Huron basins at the end of the Ice Age and would have been about 25 feet higher than Green Bay is today.",

(ii) From the north, hike the White Birch Trail (Forest Trail 567) south 1.1 mi, cross the Ice Age Trail (TA18) and continue south another 0.5 mi to its intersection with the Chippewa Lobe Interpretive Loop. This is less scenic than the Ice Age Trail access. (iii) From the east, hike the Ice Age Trail 1.6 mi west of where the Ice Age Trail leaves FR-102 after crossing the North Fork of the Yellow River. A steel sign marks the trail junction (TA16).  The Chippewa Lobe Interpretive Loop, also called the Blue Diamond Trail due to its blazes, is a rugged route that circles a remote roadless area called the Ice Age Primitive Area. Six posts mark the miles oriented counter-clockwise, starting from the Ice Age Trails western access to it at the kiosk. During wet weather, the loop may not be passable, as the Yellow River tributaries flow west to east through the entire section, with little structure at critical wet crossings. A primitive campsite (TA24) is located on the loop 0.1 miles south of its western intersection with the Ice Age Trail. A second secluded, primitive campsite (TA17) is located at the southern end of the loop, 2.7 miles south of the Ice Age Trails western intersection and 1.9 miles south of the Ice Age Trails eastern intersection. Situated with pleasant views of the pond and beaver dam, the exceptional site has a log bench, fire pit and small cast iron table made from an old fire grate. A pit toilet is hidden a few yards to the southeast.",

Designated in 1952 as Wisconsins first State Natural Area, Parfreys Glen offers a 0.7-mile nature trail that passes through a spectacular deep gorge carved into the sandstone conglomerate of embedded quartzite pebbles and boulders on the south flank of the Baraboo Hills. The uppermost part of the Glen, with its jumble of huge fallen rocks, is nearly 100 feet deep. Hikers will pass moss-covered walls moist from seepage before the trail ends at a small waterfall. The Glens unique microclimate grows northern flora, including white pine, yellow birch, mountain maple and rare cliff plants. An unusual aquatic ecosystem flourishes in the fast, cold, hardwater stream that flows through the gorge and the Glen harbors a diverse insect fauna with a few rare and threatened species. Pets are not allowed in Parfreys Glen SNA except along the Ice Age Trail.",

This is also the very same land where Aldo Leopold died in 1948 fighting a brush fire. The Legacy Center is an excellent place to learn more about this famous American naturalist and see how the Leopold Foundation is carrying out his message of land ethics today.

The name Colsac is the phonetic rendering of the two counties the ferry connects, Columbia and Sauk. The ferry crosses the Wisconsin River at a wider part of the river known as Lake Wisconsin, which is a reservoir produced by a dam downstream. At that spot, it is both the Wisconsin River and Lake Wisconsin. The ferry takes seven minutes to cross approximately 0.45 miles. State-operated, the service is free to all, including cars, bikes and pedestrians, and runs 24 hours, 7 days a week April 15 through November 30. The ferry is closed December 1 through April 14. There is a separate lane for pedestrians and bicycles, boarding from the sidewalk on the east (upriver) side of the ferry. Contact the IATA (800-227-0046, iceagetrail.org) for an alternative pedestrian route when the ferry is closed.",

Two Creeks Buried Forest is a unit of the Ice Age National Scientific Reserve. It is world-famous among geologists because it provides a unique, precise record of glacial advances and retreats during the Wisconsin Glaciation. The layers of glacial till and buried forest can be seen on the side of the steep bluff along the lakeshore due to wave erosion. Some features may be harder to see during the summer months because of ground cover. Wood from the forest has been radiocarbon-dated at 11,850 years before present.

The Cardy Site, marked by a kiosk and plaque, preserves the remains of a campsite used by Native Americans at the end of the Ice Age. An extensive dig in 2003 unearthed spear points, tools, a fire pit and other artifacts. Archeologists believe that Native Americans lived and worked in this area 11,000 years ago near the shore of Glacial Lake Algonquin and within walking distance of the receding continental ice sheet. This camp is unusual for its far north location. Glacial Lake Algonquin occupied the Lake Michigan and Lake Huron basins at the end of the Ice Age and would have been about 25 feet higher than Green Bay is today.",

The Glens unique microclimate grows northern flora, including white pine, yellow birch, mountain maple and rare cliff plants. An unusual aquatic ecosystem flourishes in the fast, cold, hardwater stream that flows through the gorge and the Glen harbors a diverse insect fauna with a few rare and threatened species.

The name Colsac is the phonetic rendering of the two counties the ferry connects, Columbia and Sauk. The ferry crosses the Wisconsin River at a wider part of the river known as Lake Wisconsin, which is a reservoir produced by a dam downstream. At that spot, it is both the Wisconsin River and Lake Wisconsin. The ferry takes seven minutes to cross approximately 0.45 miles. State-operated, the service is free to all, including cars, bikes and pedestrians, and runs 24 hours, 7 days a week April 15 through November 30. The ferry is closed December 1 through April 14. There is a separate lane for pedestrians and bicycles, boarding from the sidewalk on the east (upriver) side of the ferry.

The layers of glacial till and buried forest can be seen on the side of the steep bluff along the lakeshore due to wave erosion. Some features may be harder to see during the summer months because of ground cover. Wood from the forest has been radiocarbon-dated at 11,850 years before present.

Spruce St.  The Cardy Paleo-Indian Camp archaeological site, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is considered one of the most important archaeological finds in Wisconsin. The Cardy Site, marked by a kiosk and plaque, preserves the remains of a campsite used by Native Americans at the end of the Ice Age. An extensive dig in 2003 unearthed spear points, tools, a fire pit and other artifacts. Archeologists believe that Native Americans lived and worked in this area 11,000 years ago near the shore of Glacial Lake Algonquin and within walking distance of the receding continental ice sheet. This camp is unusual for its far north location. Glacial Lake Algonquin occupied the Lake Michigan and Lake Huron basins at the end of the Ice Age and would have been about 25 feet higher than Green Bay is today.",
